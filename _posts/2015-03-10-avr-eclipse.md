title: AVR Eclipse Plugin
excerpt: ''
---

Many people's starter into the world of hardware hacking used to be the AVR microcontrollers. Today, small ARM starter boards are a lot cheaper. But if you want to understand what happens in a microcontroller, something simpler such as the AVRs is still your best choice.

There is a project "[AVR Plugin for Eclipse](https://sourceforge.net/projects/avr-eclipse/)" that makes programming AVRs with Eclipse real fun. However, I found it to be in a kind of "intermediate state" lately. That's why I started my [fork on GitHub](https://github.com/mnlipp/avr-eclipse-fork), thus trying to keep this plugin useable for me and for others.
