title: OSGi Getting Started
excerpt: ''
---

For the nth time I tried to do something with OSGi. And again I found all the "hands on" introductions rather difficult. They all start with a lot of "install this and that", "click here and there". But all you really need to get started is basic knowledge of the JDK. If this is your starting point, and you want to get a first "hands on" experience with what OSGi is about, have a look at [my introduction](osgi-getting-started/) into the topic.
