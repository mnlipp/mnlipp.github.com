title: JDrupes MDoclet and PlantUML-Taglet
excerpt: ''
---

I got destracted, and -- as several times before -- started a search for 
UML tools.
This time, I came across [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) and 
liked it. I also found 
[pegdown-doclet](https://github.com/Abnaxos/pegdown-doclet) that
allows you to use PlantUML in your javadoc and provides 
support for using Markdown. Why did I never think of this before?
What a great idea!

I immediately got some ideas about extending the support for PlantUML.
But I didn't like that the doclet mixes the Markdown feature with
the PlantUML support. And [pegdown](https://github.com/sirthias/pegdown/)
is deprecated, so I didn't want to build on it. So I decided to
restructure the doclet. The Markdown support is now provided by 
[MDoclet](https://github.com/mnlipp/jdrupes-mdoclet#mdoclet), based on
[flexmark-java](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java) and without
any dependency on PlantUML. The PlantUML support is provided by the
[plantuml-taglet](https://mnlipp.github.io/jdrupes-taglets/plantuml-taglet/javadoc/)
which can be used independently, i.e. with the standard doclet as well as
with MDoclet.

This took longer than expected, so the new PlantUML features will have
to wait a bit, but I now have a good starting point.
